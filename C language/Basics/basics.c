//C Introduction
//C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972.
//It is a powerful and efficient language that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development.
//C is a procedural programming language, which means that it focuses on writing procedures or routines to perform specific tasks.
//C is a compiled language, which means that the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before it can be executed.
//C is a low-level language, which means that it provides direct access to memory and hardware, making it suitable for system programming and performance-critical applications.

//What is C used for?
/* C is often used to create programs that need to run fast and work closely with the computer.

-Operating systems, such as parts of Windows, Linux, and macOS
-Programs inside devices like cars, TVs, and home electronics
-Software that needs to be fast, including databases and system tools
-Game engines and programs that handle graphics
-Core libraries that other programming languages rely on*/
